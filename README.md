Dopamine behavioural management trigger

## Justification
While working, I usually follow the 'do work, get reward after' setup, on 15min timers.
The problem is that these rewards all take different times and are all decentralised.
Thus, I've created this script to select rewards for me, to centralise the 'hit' of dopamine into running the script, not the reward activity itself.
Once I pavlov myself, I can begin to introduce and change specific weightings of the reward, such that now 1/2 the time I get nothing, but I still feel the dopamine because it's linked to the script usage, not the reward.
I wish to gachafy my life.
